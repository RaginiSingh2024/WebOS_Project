# 🪟 Window OS - A Web-based Operating System

This is a mini operating system created using only **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It looks like a real desktop screen where you can open and move windows, use mini apps like Notepad or Calculator, and see icons just like on a computer.

## 🛠️ How I Made It ❤️

### 1. HTML

- I created `index.html` as the main desktop screen.
- I added icons and windows using `div` elements.
- Each app is a separate HTML file inside the `apps/` folder.

  ### 2. CSS
- I used CSS to style windows, icons, and the taskbar.
- Used `position: absolute` and `z-index` to move windows on top.
- Used `flexbox` and `grid` to align items on the desktop.

### 3. JavaScript
- I wrote JavaScript to:
  - Drag windows
  - Open and close apps
  - Focus (bring to front) active window
  - Add taskbar buttons when apps open
  - (Optional) Add right-click menu and dark mode
